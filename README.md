The German Enigma Machine was an encryption machine used by the Germans during World War II. Before outbreak of war, it was thought to be an unbreakable cypher. The riddle of Enigma was famously solved by a team of mathematicians including Alan Turing at Bletchley Park. 

The Enigma Machine's design is simple and powerful. When you press a letter on the keyboard, an electric current goes from the keyboard to a plugboard. If the letter is connected to another letter in the plugboard, it acts as though that letter was pressed instead. The current then continues its journey and heads to the rotors. Before the current reaches the rotor, the rightmost rotor is shifted one position. The middle rotor shifts once the rightmost rotor has compeleted a full revolution, and the left rotor shifts once the middle rotor has completed a full rotation. At the rightmost rotor, it enters and goes through all three rotors and then hits a reflector which maps it to another letter and sends it back through the rotors.

This ensures that the letter sent into the machine would never be outputted as the same letter. This was one of the main weaknesses of the Enigma Machine and helped the cryptographers at Bletchley Park crack it.

Overall there were 15 billion billion possible settings for the machine when considering how the rotors could be configured, which rotors would be used, the plugboard and the reflector. It's easy to see why the Germans were confident that it was uncrackable.
